Hi everyone, I just created a Lektor blog post. I want to use this blog to document my outreachy journey. Currently I'm in the contribution stage and i'm contributing to creative commons project. This is how i learnt about Lektor. Lektor is one of the tools used in building one of CC's websites. The contribution period has been exciting and has taught me a lot about collaboration, and open source.Stay tuned for a series of amazing blog posts about my journey.
